##  Features

### Sorting Visualizer
- Supports Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort  
- Visualizes each step with animated bars  
- Custom/random array generation  
- Adjustable array size and animation speed  
- Explanation box for each algorithm

### Graph Visualizer
- Interactive graph creation (random or custom input)  
- Support for directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted edges  and acyclic graph
- Algorithms planned: BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths (e.g., Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford)  
- Clean, glassmorphic design 
- Explanation box for each algorithm
- Traversal order output
